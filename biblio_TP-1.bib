   abstract = {Phytotropins such as 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA)
strongly inhibit auxin efflux, but the mechanism of this inhibition
remains unknown. Auxin efflux is also strongly decreased by the vesicle
trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Using suspension-cultured
interphase cells of the BY-2 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv
Bright-Yellow 2) cell line, we compared the effects of NPA and BFA on
auxin accumulation and on the arrangement of the cytoskeleton and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The inhibition of auxin efflux (stimulation
of net accumulation) by both NPA and BFA occurred rapidly with no
measurable lag. NPA had no observable effect on the arrangement of
microtubules, actin filaments, or ER. Thus, its inhibitory effect on
auxin efflux was not mediated by perturbation of the cytoskeletal system
and ER. BFA, however, caused substantial alterations to the arrangement
of actin filaments and ER, including a characteristic accumulation of
actin in the perinuclear cytoplasm. Even at saturating concentrations,
NPA inhibited net auxin efflux far more effectively than did BFA.
Therefore, a proportion of the NPA-sensitive auxin efflux carriers may
be protected from the action of BFA. Maximum inhibition of auxin efflux
occurred at concentrations of NPA substantially below those previously
reported to be necessary to perturb vesicle trafficking. We found no
evidence to support recent suggestions that the action of auxin
transport inhibitors is mediated by a general inhibition of
vesicle-mediated protein traffic to the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {In the mission of plant husbandry, light is a critical yet passive entity. The potential to actively implement dynamic lighting strategies to control plant growth and development holds great promise in the future of plant cultivation. In other words, rather than simply using a single stable light condition to maintain photosynthesis, might it be possible to continually adjust fluence rate, wavelength combinations, and photoperiods to actively manipulate plant morphology and production? Research over the past 100 years suggests that it is so, and today's solid-state, narrow bandwidth lighting platforms offer a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. The goal of this report is to describe the potential use of light as a growth regulator. Here light-emitting diode technology is well suited for the application, because light quantity, quality, photoperiod, and combinations thereof can be controlled with great precision. Specific light combinations may be adjusted throughout the life of a plant to potentially optimize traits of interest such as synchronization of flowering, maintenance of vegetative growth programs, control of plant stature, or acceleration of juvenility. This report describes the plant photosensory networks and how they sense and respond to light. The connection between light and internal hormone stasis is explored and then extended to questions of designing specific regimes to control plant growth and development. The concept of static signaling states is presented as a means to tightly control plant habits, in essence, using light to stabilize plant signal transduction pathways and their associated outcomes. Finally, the concepts presented are applied to the diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. These experiments provide proof-of-concept and lay a foundation for further studies.},

	abstract = {The transition from a dark-grown (etiolated) to a light-grown (de-etiolated) morphology is marked by a number of dramatic phenotypic changes such as a significant reduction in the rate of shoot elongation, opening of the apical hook, expansion of true leaves and the development of mature chloroplasts. Many of these developmental processes are also known to be regulated by plant hormones. In this review we discuss the interactions between light and plant hormones and their role in mediating phenotypic change during de-etiolation. Clear evidence exists for a light-mediated reduction in gibberellin A, GA levels and response in pea, which is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the reduction of shoot elongation during de-etiolation. Indirect evidence from a number of species has been used to suggest that the reduction in shoot elongation could also be mediated by a reduction in brassinosteroid (BR) levels. However, direct evidence recently obtained from pea and rice demonstrates that de-etiolation is not mediated, or even accompanied, by a reduction in BR levels. Ethylene is known to play an integral role in apical hook formation and maintenance in plants. However, the physiological significance of light-induced changes in IAA and ABA levels found in some species is not clear. Recent molecular data provide evidence of interactions between light-and IAA/CK-signalling pathways. Potential mechanisms for these interactions are discussed.},

These include phototropism, light-induced stomatal opening, and chloroplast movements in response to changes in light intensity. Since the isolation of the Arabidopsis PHOT1 gene in 1997, phototropins have been identified in ferns and mosses where their physiological functions appear to be conserved. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, phot1 and phot2, that exhibit overlapping functions in addition to having unique physiological roles. Phototropins are light-activated serine/threonine protein kinases. Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by a repeated motif at the N-terminal region of the protein known as the LOV domain. Photoexcitation of the LOV domain results in receptor autophosphorylation and an initiation of phototropin signaling. Here we summarize the photochemical and biochemical events underlying phototropin activation in addition to the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with photoreceptor signaling.},

These discoveries established a molecular framework to study the role of auxin in land plant evolution. Here, we review recent advances in auxin biology and their implications in both micro- and macro-evolution of plant morphology. By analogy to the term ‘hoxology’, which refers to the critical role of HOX genes in metazoan evolution, we propose to introduce the term ‘auxology’ to take into account the crucial role of auxin in plant evo-devo.},

 redistribution and/or polar transport of indoleacetic acid. Polar
 transport of auxin can be inhibited through the application of
 phytotropins such as 1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). When
 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown in the light
 on medium containing 1.0 μm NPA, hypocotyl and root
 elongation and gravitropism were strongly inhibited. When grown in
 darkness, however, NPA disrupted the gravity response but did not
 affect elongation. The extent of inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by
 NPA increased in a fluence-rate-dependent manner to a maximum of about
 75\% inhibition at 50 μmol m−2 s−1 of white
 light. Plants grown under continuous blue or far-red light showed
 NPA-induced hypocotyl inhibition similar to that of white-light-grown
 plants. Plants grown under continuous red light showed less NPA-induced
 inhibition. Analysis of photoreceptor mutants indicates the involvement
 of phytochrome and cryptochrome in mediating this NPA response.
 Hypocotyls of some auxin-resistant mutants had decreased sensitivity to
 NPA in the light, but etiolated seedlings of these mutants were similar
 in length to the wild type. These results indicate that light has a
 significant effect on NPA-induced inhibition in Arabidopsis, and
 suggest that auxin has a more important role in elongation responses in
 light-grown than in dark-grown seedlings.},

	abstract = {Phytochromes are red (R)/far-red (FR) light photoreceptors that play fundamental roles in photoperception of the light environment and the subsequent adaptation of plant growth and development. There are five distinct phytochromes in Arabidopsis thaliana, designated phytochrome A (phyA) to phyE. phyA is light-labile and is the primary photoreceptor responsible for mediating photomorphogenic responses in FR light, whereas phyB-phyE are light stable, and phyB is the predominant phytochrome regulating de-etiolation responses in R light. Phytochromes are synthesized in the cytosol in their inactive Pr form. Upon light irradiation, phytochromes are converted to the biologically active Pfr form, and translocate into the nucleus. phyB can enter the nucleus by itself in response to R light, whereas phyA nuclear import depends on two small plant-specific proteins FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) and FHY1-LIKE (FHL). Phytochromes may function as light-regulated serine/threonine kinases, and can phosphorylate several substrates, including themselves in vitro. Phytochromes are phosphoproteins, and can be dephosphorylated by a few protein phosphatases. Photoactivated phytochromes rapidly change the expression of light-responsive genes by repressing the activity of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting several photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors for degradation, and by inducing rapid phosphorylation and degradation of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs), a group of bHLH transcription factors repressing photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are targeted by COP1 for degradation via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway.},
